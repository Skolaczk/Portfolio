## Project Overview üéâ

It's my portfolio page made in Gatsby.js. I used this technology because gatsby is a static page generator which was perfect for this project. I organized the structure of the projects, splitting them into assets, components, hooks, templates and pages. On this page you can find information about me You can also send an email directly from the website. This functionality was done using the <a href="https://www.emailjs.com/">EmailJS</a> tool. Remember about the correct data in the form as it is validated!

## Installation üíæ

```sh

Then start the project on the local server with the command:

```sh
