          I&apos;m Micha≈Ç Skolak, I&apos;m a front-end developer from Poland.
          I&apos;ve been learning programming for over 3 years. After I started
          high school, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. My
          favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the
          feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. I&apos;ve had
          the opportunity to work on several exciting projects during my
          learning journey, ranging from personal projects to collaborative
          ventures. My core stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind
          CSS. I am also familiar with Nest.js and Prisma. I am always looking
          to learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to Job opportunities where I can contribute, learn and
          grow. If you have a good opportunity that matches my skills and
          experience then don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
        </p>

      <Skills />
